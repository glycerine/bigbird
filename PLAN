PLAN of attack:

a) In order to allow type-checking, we accumulate a program of go source code.

    We don't run the entire program each time, as this could be quite slow to run
      if there has been significant computation up to this point.

    But: by keeping full source code, we can
      1. readily discern the full types of the code in the program.
      2. Lets us delegate the type-checking to the go libraries.

    The source doesn't necessarily need to reflect the logic that has been
         executed in the history up to this point, but it does need to represent the
         types thus far defined so that they can be checked.


b) after type-checking of accumulated source, turn the most recent line into scheme, and evaluate it.
